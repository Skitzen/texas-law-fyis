# Can Cops in Texas Get a Search Warrant for You Leaving a Drug Dealer’s House?

In **Texas**, simply **leaving a drug dealer’s house** is **not enough** on its own for police to obtain a **search warrant** for you. However, law enforcement may be able to justify a search warrant or stop you based on additional **probable cause** or **circumstances**, including:

## 1. Surveillance & Patterns of Activity
- If police have been watching the house for a while and see **multiple people engaging in hand-to-hand transactions**, they may **assume drug activity** and use that to justify stopping you.
- If you **frequently visit a known drug house**, especially for **short stays**, they may use that as part of their affidavit for a warrant.

## 2. Direct Observation of a Drug Transaction
- If officers **witness** what they believe is a **drug transaction** (e.g., you handing over cash and receiving a small object in return), they **may stop you immediately** or use that to request a search warrant.

## 3. Informants or Controlled Buys
- If police **used an informant** or an undercover officer to make a drug purchase at the house, they can use that information to justify **stopping you** or obtaining a search warrant.

## 4. Traffic Stops & Probable Cause
- If police see you **leaving a known drug house**, they might **follow you and wait for a traffic violation** (e.g., speeding, broken taillight) to **pull you over**.
- If you appear **nervous**, have drug paraphernalia in plain view, or if they smell drugs, they might escalate the situation.
- If a drug-sniffing dog alerts to your vehicle, they can conduct a **warrantless search**.

## 5. Search Warrants for the Residence
- If police obtain a **search warrant for the drug house**, they may include a clause allowing them to **search anyone leaving the house** during the execution of the warrant.

## Key Takeaways
- **Leaving a drug house alone is NOT enough** for a search warrant.
- Police need **probable cause**—such as **witnessing a transaction, informant tips, or evidence of ongoing drug activity**.
- They may use **traffic violations** to initiate a stop and search you **without a warrant**.
- If you are stopped, **do not consent to a search** and **ask if you are free to leave**.

Here are some key **Texas laws and legal precedents** that outline when law enforcement can obtain a **search warrant** or conduct a **stop and search** based on someone leaving a drug house:

## 1. Search Warrants & Probable Cause
### **Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) – Article 18.01**
- A search warrant in Texas **must be based on probable cause** supported by a sworn affidavit.

### **Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85 (1979)** – U.S. Supreme Court
- Holding: **Mere presence in a place where illegal activity occurs does not give police automatic authority to search individuals**.

## 2. Traffic Stops After Leaving a Drug House
### **Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806 (1996)** – U.S. Supreme Court
- Officers **may stop a vehicle for any traffic violation**, even if their true motive is suspicion of drug activity.  
- This means **police can follow you** after leaving a drug house and **wait for a minor traffic violation** to justify a stop.

### **Rodriguez v. United States, 575 U.S. 348 (2015)**
- Police **cannot extend a traffic stop** beyond its original purpose **without reasonable suspicion**.

## 3. When Can Police Search Without a Warrant?
### **Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)** – Terry Stops (Stop and Frisk)
- Police can **briefly detain and pat down** a person if they have **reasonable suspicion** that the person is armed or engaged in criminal activity.  
- However, **just leaving a drug house is NOT enough** for a Terry stop.

### **Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132 (1925)** – Automobile Exception
- If police have **probable cause** that a vehicle contains drugs, they **can search it without a warrant**.  
- **Example**: If an officer sees drugs or paraphernalia in plain view after stopping you, they may legally search the vehicle.

### **Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332 (2009)**
- Police **cannot search a vehicle incident to arrest** unless the suspect is **within reaching distance** of the car or police have **probable cause** to believe evidence of the crime is inside.

## 4. Can Police Detain or Search People Leaving a Drug House?
### **Bailey v. United States, 568 U.S. 186 (2013)**

### **Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979)**
- Holding: **Police cannot stop someone just because they are in a high-crime area**.
