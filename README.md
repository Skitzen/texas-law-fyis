## âš– Know Your Rights

> **We do not condone criminal activity.** However, sometimes you might find yourself in a situation that makes it **appear** as if you are committing a crime.

## ðŸš¨ Why This Matters

Law enforcement **routinely oversteps** legal boundaries, often relying on:
- **Fabricated probable cause**
- **Illegal searches**
- **Coerced confessions**
- **Entrapment tactics**
- **Misuse of surveillance tools**

Many people have been falsely arrested because officers **lied or misrepresented evidence** in police reports. 

âš  **America is under attack, and activists are being targeted.** If you are an activist, protester, journalist, or outspoken individual, you should assume **you are under surveillance**. Police have historically used **laws as weapons** to silence dissent.
